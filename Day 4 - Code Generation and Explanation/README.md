## Tasks

##### 0\. Code generation and explanation

Now it’s your turn to explore the capabilities of AI for code generation and explanation!

1.  **Choose a simple coding problem:** Select a small programming task.
2.  **Formulate a clear prompt:** Write a detailed prompt for an AI model (like Gemini, ChatGPT, or another code-generating AI you have access to). Make sure to specify:

    - The programming language you want the code in.
    - The exact problem you want to solve.
    - Any specific requirements or constraints (e.g., “use a loop,” “handle potential errors”).
    - Explicitly ask the AI to explain the generated code step-by-step.

3.  **Generate and Review the Code:** Input your prompt into the AI and examine the generated code.
4.  **Request Explanations:** Use the interactive features of the AI environment (if available) to ask for explanations of specific parts of the code that you don’t understand.
5.  **Experiment with Prompts:** Modify your original prompt slightly and see how the AI’s response changes. For example, ask for the code in a different language, add a new constraint, or ask for a different style of explanation.
6.  Write the “first prompt” that asks a more general question about common software design patterns for managing communication or dependencies between different components in a large application and their respective trade-offs (scalability, complexity, coupling).
7.  Use the AI’s answer from the first prompt to formulate a “followup prompt” that asks for a recommendation on the _most suitable_ pattern for your specific scenario (event notification, large application, scalability needs) and asks for a simple code sketch demonstrating its implementation in your language of choice (e.g., Python, Java, C#).
