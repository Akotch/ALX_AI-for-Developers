## Tasks

##### 0\. Time to build

Time to build something with the tools discussed. You will apply the concepts and techniques learned about leveraging AI in software development to build a practical web application. While the project itself is a standard web development task, the expectation is that you will actively use AI tools, particularly the AI Chatbots and prompt engineering strategies discussed in the previous projects and concept pages, to assist you throughout the development process – from planning and code generation to debugging and refinement.

When you finish:

- Then, choose any **one of the following options** to submit your work:
  - Post it on social media (like X, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.)
  - Upload it to Google Drive
  - Create a Google Doc or Google Slide
- Submit the link to your post, file, or document.
