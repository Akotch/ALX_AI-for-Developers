## Tasks

##### 0\. Generating Code with Context and System Constraints

You are working on a Node.js project that uses the Express framework and the Mongoose library for interacting with a MongoDB database. You need to create a new API endpoint that retrieves a user by their ID.

Write a prompt that uses **Contextual Prompting** to inform the AI about the project’s technology stack (Node.js, Express, Mongoose) and the specific task (get user by ID from MongoDB). Additionally, use **System Prompting** to instruct the AI to return _only_ the JavaScript code for the Express route handler function, with no extra text or explanation.

When you finish:

- Take a screenshot of your prompt and the AI’s response (you can use any AI chatbot).
- Then, choose any **one of the following options** to submit your work:
  - Post it on social media (like X, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.)
  - Upload it to Google Drive
  - Create a Google Doc or Google Slide
- Submit the link to your post, file, or document.
