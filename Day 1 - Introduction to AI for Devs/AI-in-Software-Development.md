Week 1, Day 2: Impact of AI in Software Development

AI is changing how we build software. It helps us write code faster and fix problems quickly. But it's not all perfect. Here’s what I think so far: ...

The good part? AI tools can save a lot of time. They can write small pieces of code, explain errors, or even give ideas when you're stuck. It feels like working with a smart assistant.

The bad part? If we use AI too much, we might stop learning. We may get the answer without understanding how it works. And that can be a problem when something goes wrong.

So what’s the right approach? (In my opinion). I think it’s about balance: Letting AI boost your workflow without replacing your thinking. Use it to learn, to speed up, but not to skip the hard parts. [#ALX_AIDEV](https://x.com/hashtag/ALX_AIDEV?src=hashtag_click)
