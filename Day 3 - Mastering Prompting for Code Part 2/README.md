## Tasks

##### 0\. Apply Step-back or Chain of Thought Prompting

You are building a new feature in a large application where different parts of the system need to be notified whenever a specific event occurs (e.g., a user updates their profile). You are considering implementing this using a common design pattern, but you’re not sure which one (e.g., Observer, Pub/Sub, Signals/Slots) is the most suitable for your application’s architecture, scalability needs, and maintainability.

Design a sequence of prompts using **Step-back Prompting** to help you decide on the best design pattern for handling this event notification system.

- Write the “first prompt” that asks a more general question about common software design patterns for managing communication or dependencies between different components in a large application and their respective trade-offs (scalability, complexity, coupling).
- Use the AI’s answer from the first prompt to formulate a “followup prompt” that asks for a recommendation on the _most suitable_ pattern for your specific scenario (event notification, large application, scalability needs) and asks for a simple code sketch demonstrating its implementation in your language of choice (e.g., Python, Java, C#).
